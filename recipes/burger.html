    <p>Crispy seasoned chicken breast, topped with mandatory melted cheese and piled onto soft rolls with onion, avocado, lettuce, tomato and garlic mayo. Quick to make for a midweek meal, great for gatherings!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 grams Ground Chicken</li>
        <li>30 grams Olives</li>
        <li>4 slices of bread</li>
        <li>4 leaves of lettuce</li>
        <li>salt (to your liking)</li>
        <li>spicy sauce (to your liking)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>1. Finely chop the olives and mix in a bowl with the ground chicken and salt</p>
    <p>2. Heat some oil in a pan and after shaping 2 chicken patties using either your hands or a burger mold place them in the hot oil. A handy tip is to wet your hands or the mold to prevent sticking. Ground chicken is generally a lot stickier than beef or pork.</p>
    <p>3. Fry the patty for 3-4 min of each side on a medium heat till cooked through. Then place the patties between two sliecs of bread, lettuce and sauce. Then enjoy!</p>
